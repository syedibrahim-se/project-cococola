                        <h1 id="s-h">Early Marketing and Expansion</h1>
                        <p id="s-p">Asa Candler, a businessman, bought the formula and brand rights in 1888 and founded The Coca-Cola Company. Under his leadership, Coca-Cola grew rapidly, and Candler's aggressive marketing tactics helped make Coca-Cola a household name.

                        <h1 id="s-h">The Birth of Coca-Cola</h1>
                        <p id="s-p">To avoid Atlanta's prohibition laws, the wine was replaced with sugar syrup, and on May 8, 1886, the drink was officially named "Coca-Cola." The term "Coca" came from the coca leaf (used to flavor the drink), and "Cola" from the kola nut (a source of caffeine).</p>

                        <h1 id="s-h">Trademark and Bottling System</h1>
                        <p id="s-p"> In 1892, Candler formed The Coca-Cola Company and obtained the exclusive rights to the Coca-Cola name and formula. He also began granting licenses to independent bottling companies, a strategy that helped Coca-Cola expand rapidly across the United States.</p>

                        <h1 id="s-h">The Contour Bottle</h1>
                        <p id="s-p">In 1916, the iconic Coca-Cola bottle, designed by the Root Glass Company, was introduced. Its distinctive contour shape made it instantly recognizable and became a symbol of the brand.
